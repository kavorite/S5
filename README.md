# S5: Simple State Space Layers for Sequence Modeling

This repository provides the official implementation and experiments for the 
paper: Simplified State Space Layers for Sequence Modeling.  The preprint is available [here](https://arxiv.org/TBDNEEDTOUPDATE). 
The core contribution is the S5 layer which is meant to simplify the prior
S4 approach [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.00396) while retaining its performance and efficiency.

While it has departed a fair amount, this repository originally started off with much of the JAX implementation of S4 from the
Annotated S4 blog post by Sasha Rush (available [here](https://github.com/srush/annotated-s4)). 

## Experiments
The Long Range Arena and 
Speech Commands experiments in the paper were performed using the dataloaders from the [Official S4 repository](https://github.com/HazyResearch/state-spaces). 
We are currently in the process of adding dataloaders better suited for our JAX implementation.

We currently provide the ability to run the LRA-Text (character level IMDb classification) experiment easily in a Google Colab notebook (<a href="https://githubtocolab.com/lindermanlab/S5/blob/main/Examples/S5_IMDB_Classification.ipynb" target="_parent"><img src="https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg" alt="Open in Colab"/></a>). 
The rest of the experiments will be added soon!


## Requirements
If using the Google Colab environment, all requirements are already installed.

To run the code on your own machine, you will need to first install JAX following the instructions at: https://github.com/google/jax#installation, 
before installing the requirements.txt file.
